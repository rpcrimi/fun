scikit-neuralnetwork
====================

Deep neural network implementation without the learning cliff!  This library implements multi-layer perceptrons, auto-encoders and (soon) recurrent neural networks with a stable Future Proof™ interface that's compatible with ``scikit-learn`` for a more user-friendly and Pythonic interface. It's a wrapper for powerful existing libraries such as ``lasagne`` currently, with plans for ``blocks``.

**NOTE**: This project is possible thanks to the `nucl.ai Conference <http://nucl.ai/>`_ on **July 18-20**. Join us in **Vienna**!

Features
--------

By importing the ``sknn`` package provided by this library, you can easily train deep neural networks as regressors (to estimate continuous outputs from inputs) and classifiers (to predict discrete labels from features).

.. image:: docs/plot_activation.png

Thanks to the underlying ``Lasagne`` implementation, the code supports the following neural network features — exposed in an intuitive and `well documented <http://scikit-neuralnetwork.readthedocs.org/>`_ API:

* **Activation Functions —** ``Sigmoid``, ``Tanh``, ``Rectifier``, ``Softmax``, ``Linear``.
* **Layer Types —** ``Convolution`` (greyscale and color, 2D), ``Dense`` (standard, 1D).
* **Learning Rules —** ``sgd``, ``momentum``, ``nesterov``, ``adadelta``, ``adagrad``, ``rmsprop``, ``adam``.
* **Regularization —** ``L1``, ``L2``, ``dropout``, and batch normalization.
* **Dataset Formats —** ``numpy.ndarray``, ``scipy.sparse``, ``pandas.DataFrame`` and iterators (via ``callback``).

If a feature you need is missing, consider opening a `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork/issues>`_ with a detailed explanation about the use case and we'll see what we can do.


Installation & Testing
----------------------

A) Download Latest Release [Recommended]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use the latest official release, you can do so from PYPI directly::

    > pip install scikit-neuralnetwork

This will install the latest official ``Lasagne`` and ``Theano`` as well as other minor packages too as a dependency.  We strongly suggest you use a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ for Python.

B) Pulling Repositories [Optional]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use the more advanced features like convolution, pooling or upscaling, these depend on the latest code from ``Lasagne`` and ``Theano`` master branches.  You can install them manually as follows::

    > pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork/master/requirements.txt

Once that's done, you can grab this repository and install from ``setup.py`` in the exact same way::

    > git clone https://github.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork.git
    > cd scikit-neuralnetwork; python setup.py develop
    
This will make the ``sknn`` package globally available within Python as a reference to the current directory.

Running Automated Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: docs/console_tests.png

Then, you can run the samples and benchmarks available in the ``examples/`` folder, or launch the tests to check everything is working::

    > pip install nose
    > nosetests -v sknn.tests

We strive to maintain 100% test coverage for all code-paths, to ensure that rapid changes in the underlying backend libraries are caught automatically.

Getting Started
---------------

The library supports both regressors (to estimate continuous outputs from inputs) and classifiers (to predict discrete labels from features).  This is the ``sklearn``-compatible API:

.. code:: python

    from sknn.mlp import Classifier, Layer

    nn = Classifier(
        layers=[
            Layer("Rectifier", units=100),
            Layer("Softmax")],
        learning_rate=0.02,
        n_iter=10)
    nn.fit(X_train, y_train)

    y_valid = nn.predict(X_valid)

    score = nn.score(X_test, y_test)

The `generated documentation <http://scikit-neuralnetwork.readthedocs.org/>`_ as a standalone page where you can find more information about parameters, as well as examples in the `User Guide <http://scikit-neuralnetwork.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html>`_.

Demonstration
-------------

To run the example that generates the visualization above using our ``sknn.mlp.Classifier``, just run the following command in the project's root folder::

    > python examples/plot_mlp.py --params activation

There are multiple parameters you can plot as well, for example ``iterations``, ``rules`` or ``units``.  The datasets are randomized each time, but the output should be an image that looks like this...
